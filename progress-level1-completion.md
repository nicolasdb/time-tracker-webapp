- Improved error handling for registration failures
- Added email confirmation flow

### 3. System Diagnostics
- Created comprehensive diagnostics panel in settings
- Implemented API endpoints for system status
- Added database connection verification
- Added record count tracking for all tables
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for robustness

### 4. UI Enhancements
- Improved login and registration pages
- Added feedback for user actions
- Ensured responsive design across screens
- Implemented clean dashboard layout

## Level 2.1 Planning: RFID Events CRUD

### 1. Core Requirements
- Complete CRUD operations for RFID events:
  - **Create**: Manual event entry form
  - **Read**: Filterable event listing with pagination 
  - **Update**: Edit individual events
  - **Delete**: Remove events with confirmation

### 2. Technical Approach
- Create dedicated `/rfid_events` routes for all operations
- Implement form validation with proper error handling
- Build reusable components with HTMX for dynamic interactions
- Optimize for performance with efficient database queries
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback

### 3. UI Considerations
- Implement clean, intuitive forms
- Add filtering and sorting capabilities
- Include pagination for large result sets
- Provide clear visual feedback for actions
- Ensure mobile-friendly layout

### 4. Implementation Steps
1. Define detailed data models and validation rules
2. Create database access layer with proper error handling
3. Implement routes and controllers for CRUD operations
4. Build templates with HTMX integration
5. Add client-side validation and UX improvements
6. Implement comprehensive testing

### 5. Dependencies & Considerations
- Will require proper Supabase permissions
- Must handle relationship with tag_assignments
- Should maintain audit trail for changes
- Need to handle edge cases (e.g., duplicate events)

## Next Steps (Level 2.1)

1. Design and implement RFID events listing page
2. Create form for manual RFID event entry
3. Implement edit functionality for existing events
4. Add delete capability with proper safeguards
5. Ensure proper error handling and validation
6. Update documentation and testing
