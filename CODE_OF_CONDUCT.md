# Code of Conduct

The "Code of Conduct" exists to create a clear, safe, and productive environment where everyone can participate fully. It provides straightforward guidelines to prevent harmful behaviors and outlines how we'll respond when issues arise.

## Our Mission and Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, political views, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:**

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Supporting others in their learning journey
* Sharing knowledge and documenting experiences when comfortable doing so

**Examples of unacceptable behavior include:**

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Harassment in any form, including intimidation, stalking, following, unwanted photography or recording, and inappropriate physical contact
* Patterns of deliberate exclusion or persistent "silent treatment" targeting specific community members
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in any professional setting

## Community Roles and Responsibilities

### For All Members

* Read and follow this Code of Conduct
* Participate in ways that maintain our community standards
* Report incidents that may violate our standards
* Help others learn and grow in our community

### For Community Leaders

* Clarify and enforce our standards of acceptable behavior
* Take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to inappropriate behavior
* Communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate
* Maintain the privacy and security of reported incidents

For now, report concerns to [@nicolasdb](https://github.com/nicolasdb). Additional reporting channels to be developed - see related communications in the Issues tab.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and when representing our community in public spaces. Examples include using official email addresses, posting via official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at events.
Our community operates from Brussels (UTC+1) while welcoming global participation. We strive to make key events and decisions accessible across time zones.

## Enforcement

Community leaders will respond to violations by:

* [ ] Documenting the incident
* [ ] Determining appropriate action
* [ ] Enforcing the decision
* [ ] Following up as needed

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and will provide regular updates on any actions taken.

* [_Access complete enforcement guidelines_](https://github.com/mozilla/inclusion/blob/master/code-of-conduct-enforcement/consequence-ladder.md)
* [_Mozilla's Community Participation Guidelines Training for Staff_](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/cpg-training-staff) - which is basically like a 'first aid course', but for enforcement.
