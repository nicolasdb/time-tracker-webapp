3. Configure Tailwind CSS with Windster
4. Establish user authentication
5. Create base template with navigation

### 🔄 Data Management Phase
1. Implement tag CRUD operations
2. Create RFID event management interface
3. Establish webhook listeners
4. Set up data validation and error handling
5. Test data flow end-to-end

### 📈 Visualization Phase
1. Implement time tracking dashboard
2. Create project breakdown visualizations
3. Develop focus metrics components
4. Ensure mobile responsiveness
5. Optimize chart performance

### 🔗 Integration Phase
1. Connect reflection system
2. Implement Cognitive Wealth metrics
3. Ensure webhook server compatibility
